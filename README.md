This project is a program that allows two human players to play a game of chess on the command line. It is built using Ruby and tested with RSpec.

The project demonstrates the integration of a variety of different programming components, including object-oriented coding and organization (classes, modules, inheritance), file reading/writing, serialization of save states, and RSpec testing (examples groups, expectations, mocks/stubs).

This branch of the project uses a single-input system for making a move on the chess board. The player inputs the position of the piece they wish to move, the word "to", and then the position of the desired move (e.g., "A2 to A3").

This project is a program that allows two human players to play a game of chess on the command line. It is built using Ruby and tested with RSpec.

The project demonstrates the integration of a variety of different programming components, including object-oriented coding and organization (classes, modules, inheritance), file reading/writing, serialization of save states, and RSpec testing (examples groups, expectations, mocks/stubs).

This project is currently in progress.

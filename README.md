This project is a program that allows two human players to play a game of chess on the command line. It is built using Ruby and tested with RSpec.

The project demonstrates the integration of a variety of different programming components, including object-oriented coding and organization (classes, modules, inheritance), file reading/writing, serialization of save states, and RSpec testing (examples groups, expectations, mocks/stubs).

This branch of the project uses a two-input system for making a move on the chess board. The player first inputs the position of the piece they wish to move, then inputs the position of the desired move.
